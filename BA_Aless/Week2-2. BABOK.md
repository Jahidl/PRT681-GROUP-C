# Applied to Our E-commerce Project – Used Tools Trading Website

We applied BABOK concepts directly to our project. We planned the scope and stakeholders, elicited requirements through team discussion, managed user stories in the lifecycle, modeled processes and mockups, and will evaluate the solution against user needs. This makes sure our e-commerce MVP is not only working technically, but also aligned to business analysis best practices.

## 1. Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring
- BABOK Focus: Define approach, stakeholders, deliverables, and monitoring.
- Our Project:
  - Approach: Agile-style iterations, MVP first.
  - Stakeholders:
    - BA (requirements, backlog grooming, mockups)
    - Developers (APIs, front-end, DB)
    - Tester (test cases, validation)
    - Admin user (product management)
  - Deliverables: User stories, business processes, mockups, requirements doc.
  - Monitoring: Weekly meetings + backlog grooming.

## 2. Elicitation & Collaboration
- BABOK Focus: Gather requirements, confirm understanding, collaborate with stakeholders.
- Our Project:
  - Discussed options and agreed on a simple e-commerce MVP.
  - BA worked with team to define Personas (Lily, Sam, Admin).
  - Used discussions and chat tools to align Dev + Test with requirements.

## 3. Requirements Life Cycle Management
- BABOK Focus: Manage requirements from creation to implementation.
- Our Project:
  - Requirements start as user stories.
  - Grooming adds acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies.
  - Developers implement → Tester writes test cases → BA tracks changes.
  - Example: “Add to Cart” story refined into steps + validation rules.

## 4. Requirements Analysis & Design Definition
- BABOK Focus: Specify, model, validate requirements and design options.
- Our Project:
  - We modeled Business Process Hierarchy (High, Mid, Low levels).
  - Defined Functional + Non-Functional Requirements.
  - Created mockups: Login, Product List, Cart, Order Confirmation.
  - Verified requirements with team before implementation.

## 5. Solution Evaluation
- BABOK Focus: Assess solution against needs.
- Our Project:
  - MVP evaluation = Can a user register → browse → add to cart → place order successfully?
  - Testers validate with sample test cases.
  - If solution doesn’t match persona needs (e.g., cart not updating), requirements will be adjusted in next iteration.
