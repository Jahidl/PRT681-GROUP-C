# Business Analysis Tools and Process Diagram Templates Knowledge Documentation
This document shows how different BA tools and process diagrams support our e-commerce project. For example, we can use Jira to track user stories, Draw.io for our business process hierarchy, and Figma to show UI mockups. These tools make requirements visible and understandable for the whole team.
## 1. Common BA Tools

- 1.1 Requirements & Backlog Management
	•	Jira

	•	Example: Store BA documents like personas, business processes, and acceptance criteria.
