# 7. Potential Obstacles & Goals 
Our main obstacles are time, experience gaps, and possible misalignment between BA, Dev, and Test. To manage this, we’re keeping scope small and focusing on MVP first.
Our goals are to deliver a working shopping flow, have clear requirements, improve team collaboration, and set a foundation for future iterations.

- Potential Obstacles
  - Time Constraints
    - We only have 3 weeks to deliver, so we must focus on MVP first.
  - Team Experience Gaps
    - The members responsible for BA are exposed to business analysis for the first time, and the learning curve may slow down the progress. Whenever possible, use Chat GPT to assist with analysis.
  - Scope Creep
    - Risk of adding too many features (payment, full CMS) instead of keeping MVP simple. ry to narrow the scope of functions and only ensure the basic functions of MVP.
  - Technical Integration Issues
    - API and front-end may not align perfectly during early iterations.
  - Collaboration & Communication
    - Misunderstandings between BA, Dev, and Test could lead to incomplete requirements or test cases.
  - Data Management
    - Setting up database migrations and keeping consistent schema across dev machines may cause errors.

- Goals
  - Deliver MVP Successfully
    - By the end of iteration, we should have a working shopping flow: Register → Browse → Add to Cart → Place Order.
  - Clarity of Requirements
    - Provide clear business processes, user stories, and acceptance criteria so developers and testers can work effectively.
  - Effective Team Collaboration
    - Ensure BA, Developers, and Testers are aligned through backlog grooming and requirement traceability.
  - Learning Objectives
    - Gain practical experience in BA tasks (Personas, requirements, user stories, business processes).
    - Developers gain practice with APIs, repo, and database setup.
    - Testers practice test design and automation basics.
  - Foundation for Future Iterations
    - Build a solid MVP now so we can extend it later with payment, admin CMS, and more advanced features.
